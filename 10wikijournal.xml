;Phylogenetic Analysis:
Infer '''evolutionary distances''' between species based on observed states > construct phylogenetic trees
:* Key is to quantitatively interpret evolutionary distance under a branching model of '''stochastic variation''' and '''selection'''

Sequence changes can cause changes in fitness, criterion of selection.

Selection requires reproduction to work. Once speciation due to reproductive separation occurs, genomes will diverge.

:* Important tasks: quantifying divergence in gene sequences, construct phylogenetic trees such that the order of branching events best explain contemporary divergence.

;Phylogenetic Tree:
A graph-abstraction of computable evolutionary relationships.

Each node is a ''species''. Each edge is a ''homology''. Lengths of the edges represent time.

:* '''Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)''': Terminal nodes. "Leaves" of phylogenetic tree. Contemporary species
:* '''Internal Nodes''': Hypothetical state of '''ancestral species'''
:* '''Root''': '''Last Common Ancestor''' or cenancestor
:* '''Monophyletic Group''': a clade - a node AND all its descendents
:* '''Paraphyletic Group''': a clade minus some of its members. This group is said to be "paraphyletic" to the excluded members/groups
:* '''Polyphyletic Group''': set of members from several clades grouped together perhaps by some similarities, but do not include a shared common ancestor of them all

;"Molecular Clock" Hypothesis:
In prehistory since speciation, amount of mutation (to have accumulated) changes linearly with time.
:* Despite its loose conception, it works surprisingly well

;Rooting phylogenetic tree:
When time-direction assumption from "molecular clock" is weighed in
:* Outgroup rooting
:* Midpoint rooting
:* Gene duplication rooting

;Types of phylogenetic tree:
:* Cladogram: only branching patterns. Meaningless lengths of edges
:* Phylogram: branch lengths correspond to amount of genetic changes
:* Ultrametric Tree: edge lengths represent time from LCA to current taxa??

;Complications not constrained by the universal "Tree of Life" -- Horizontal Gene Transfer
:* Causes incompatibility with the Common Tree
:* Detected via parametric methods: evidence by sequence composition e.g. GC contents, specific codon biases, sequence signatures
:* Detected via phylogenetic methods: evidence through observed difference between trees of species and trees of genes (cannot infer direction though)

?What are split networks?

More on concepts at [pmid 12801728]

Generally:
Trees built from maximum likelihood methods are more reliable than parsimony methods or distance methods.

However, just like in MSA, weigh in biological intuitions when applicable.

Number of all possible trees:
<source lang="R">
nTrees(11) #34459425
</source>

Seems like a lot...

;Phylogenetic analysis uses results of MSA as input.
:* Use DNA sequences for closely related sequences. Use protein sequences for distantly related sequences.
:* Quality of MSA: desirable to edit ensuring homologous residues are aligned and avoid unlikely large number of indels.
:* Avoid sequences that evolved under different models of evolution
:* Remove frayed N- or C-termini
:* The bottom line: Reduce contaminating noise in the put MSA information.


 '''''Caution! Indels/gaps are extra problematic in phylogenetic input alignments. Because phylo. programs analyze columns only, All "-" are treated the same.'''''

 '''''This is not the case in MSA, where occurance and extension are not equivalent. The result is overestimation of distance for true long indels (actual insertion), and underestimation of distance for short indels (rare)'''''


;Add an outgroup to root the tree

(e.g. With all fungi APSES sequences I have, add a Kil-A protein outside the fungi kingdom, such as E.coli. Place it as the first sequence)

;Activity - Prepare data for phylogenetic analysis by going through "BIN-PHYLO-Data_preparation.R"

Line 89:
Get annotation IDs for those that are annotating proteins selected and Feature ID 1.

Line 125:
Alignment with MUSCLE.

Line 228:
Run this instead <code>writeMFA(APSESphyloSet, myCon = "../APSESphyloSet.mfa")</code>

(In general practice, masking gaps and uncertain areas are better done in MSA editors such as JalView)

;Motivation:
Construct a tree that best represent an evolutionary model on how it shaped the current OTUs

Listing all possible trees can get astronomical and intractable. Use heuristic methods.

'''Depending on metric/model of evolution, the objective "functions" lead to respective methods.'''

;Distance-based methods:
:* Objective: the best tree have the most similar OTUs share direct ancestors
:* Compute distance matrix based on number of changes required to map between sequences. Find closest neighbours. Based off an evolutionary model.
:* Grouping sequences: Fitch/Margoliash method (minimizes branch lengths), Neighbour-joining method (minimizes deviations of branch lengths from observed distances)
:* Takes into account distance pairscores

;Parsimony-based methods:
:* Objective: the best tree minimal number of evolutionary events in a tree
:* Predicts the tree that require the fewest mutation events
:* Takes into account whole columns

Distance and parsimony based methods are fast, but less accurate.

;Maximum likelihood methods:
:* Objective: the best tree maximizes the likelihood of observed alignment

;Bayesian methods:
:* Objective: (related, but not quite the same as above) the best tree maximizes its probability given the alignment

'''''Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are typicall the methods of choice.'''''

'''Bootstrapping''' can be used to test the robustness of the tree (i.e. sensitivity to small variations in input data used for construction)

==10.4 Phylogenetic Tree Analysis==
80 min

;"Golden Rules":
:* Orthologues arise through speciation. Paralogues arise through duplication
:* Each branch point is either duplication or speciation
:* Do not assume orthology is transitive (it's not. See inparalogs and co-orthologues, when duplication occurs after speciation)
:* Gene tree should recapitulate the sequence of speciation events. '''Need a species tree'''
:* RBM: (very often) orthologues. Reason being paralogues undergo faster evolution
:* Prepare for complications arising from gene-loss, lack of resolution branch point, and horizontal gene transfer, long branch attraction

===10.4.1 Compute reference species tree===

<span style="color:red">Since I will not be able to make full use of PhyloT, I follow the following procedure to obtain reference species tree (Procedure obtained from Dr. Steipe on the mailing list).</span>

1. Get Entrez species info:

<source lang="R">
#Initiate ABC-units project
init()

#Step 1: Determine whether ERECY is an ascomycota or a basidiomycota
entrezQueryString <- function() {
   query <- character()
   for (spec in myDB$taxonomy$species) {
       query <- c(query, paste(unlist(strsplit(spec, " "))[1:2], collapse = " "))
   }
   return(paste(query, collapse = " OR "))
}

#This function requires myDB, so for me the following lines are needed:
library(jsonlite)
source("../makeProteinDB.R")

#Call the function
entrezQueryString()
</source>

2. Go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy

3. Search the following (Output of the <code>entrezQueryString()</code>)

 Aspergillus nidulans OR Bipolaris oryzae OR Coprinopsis cinerea OR Cryptococcus neoformans OR Neurospora crassa OR Puccinia graminis OR Saccharomyces cerevisiae OR Schizosaccharomyces pombe
 OR Ustilago maydis OR Wallemia mellicola OR Eremothecium cymbalariae

4. Under "Displaye Settings", choose "Common Tree"

 '''MYSPE Eremothecium cymbalariae is under Ascomycota clade'''

5. Go to phyloT at https://phylot.biobyte.de/

6. Build tree with the following tree elements of Ascomycota clade:

 227321, 930090, 367110, 559292, 284812, 931890

7. Settings:
:* "Node Identifiers": "Scientific Names"
:* "Internal Nodes": "Collapsed"
:* "Polytomy": "no"
:* "Format": "Newick"
:* Everything else default

Then, "Generate Tree" (Wow so fast..)

(The tree can be visualized in "Visualize in iTOL" as well)

8. Similarly, build tree with the following tree elements of Basidiomycota:

 671144, 240176, 418459, 237631, 214684

9. ... and for Fungi (grand tree):

(The outputs are formatted in Newick with its specific syntax)

10. Manually edit output .txt files to merge the trees. This results in "fullfungiTree.txt". Use https://itol.embl.de/upload.cgi to validate trees.

My species trees look like this:
