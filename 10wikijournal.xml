;Phylogenetic Analysis:
Infer '''evolutionary distances''' between species based on observed states > construct phylogenetic trees
:* Key is to quantitatively interpret evolutionary distance under a branching model of '''stochastic variation''' and '''selection'''

Sequence changes can cause changes in fitness, criterion of selection.

Selection requires reproduction to work. Once speciation due to reproductive separation occurs, genomes will diverge.

:* Important tasks: quantifying divergence in gene sequences, construct phylogenetic trees such that the order of branching events best explain contemporary divergence.

;Phylogenetic Tree:
A graph-abstraction of computable evolutionary relationships.

Each node is a ''species''. Each edge is a ''homology''. Lengths of the edges represent time.

:* '''Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)''': Terminal nodes. "Leaves" of phylogenetic tree. Contemporary species
:* '''Internal Nodes''': Hypothetical state of '''ancestral species'''
:* '''Root''': '''Last Common Ancestor''' or cenancestor
:* '''Monophyletic Group''': a clade - a node AND all its descendents
:* '''Paraphyletic Group''': a clade minus some of its members. This group is said to be "paraphyletic" to the excluded members/groups
:* '''Polyphyletic Group''': set of members from several clades grouped together perhaps by some similarities, but do not include a shared common ancestor of them all

;"Molecular Clock" Hypothesis:
In prehistory since speciation, amount of mutation (to have accumulated) changes linearly with time.
:* Despite its loose conception, it works surprisingly well

;Rooting phylogenetic tree:
When time-direction assumption from "molecular clock" is weighed in
:* Outgroup rooting
:* Midpoint rooting
:* Gene duplication rooting

;Types of phylogenetic tree:
:* Cladogram: only branching patterns. Meaningless lengths of edges
:* Phylogram: branch lengths correspond to amount of genetic changes
:* Ultrametric Tree: edge lengths represent time from LCA to current taxa??

;Complications not constrained by the universal "Tree of Life" -- Horizontal Gene Transfer
:* Causes incompatibility with the Common Tree
:* Detected via parametric methods: evidence by sequence composition e.g. GC contents, specific codon biases, sequence signatures
:* Detected via phylogenetic methods: evidence through observed difference between trees of species and trees of genes (cannot infer direction though)
