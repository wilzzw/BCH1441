;PDB has its own chemical database: Chemical Component Dictionary

;Access:
:* PDBeChem (EBI)
:* Ligand Expo (PDB)

;SMILE (Simplified molecular-input line-entry system) string: PDB "search by ligand" converts the chemical structure to a '''SMILE string''' that can be used to generate coordinates in Chimera.

===5.4.1 Explore caffeine through various databases===
;Activity 1 - Explore on DrugBank
: Downloadable items include PDB, SMILES, MOL, SDF, 3D-SDF, InChI

;Activity 2 - Explore on PubChem (NCBI) and search by drawing a structure
1. '''Structure search has moved. Click "Draw Structure"'''

2. Search for this structure:

[[File:caffeine_chemstruc.png|500px]]

3. The only result is "Caffeine". PubChemCID = 2519

 The SMILE string is CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C

===5.4.2 Build the structure from SMILE===
;Activity 3 - Build structure in Chimera
1. Tools > Structure Editing > Build Structure

2. Use the SMILE string to build

3. Actions > Color > by element

[[File:caffeine_chimera.png|500px]]

4. Actions > Surface > show

5. Select the surface, then selection inspector, inspect MSMS surface and change vertex density to 50.0

6. Actions > Color > all options > cornflower blue (apply to surfaces only)

7. Actions > Surface > Transparency > 50%

8. Result in wall-eyed stereo view:

[[File:caffeine_stereo.png|500px]]

9. (3D stereo view practice)

===5.4.3 Superposition of small molecule into complex===
1. Chimera "open 3g6m"

2. Hide protein ribbons and atoms/bonds (there are 2 caffeine molecules in the complex!)

3. Hide one caffeine molecule from the complex <code>~display #1:1</code>

4. Inspect atom notations, here's the command in Chimera I use: <code>match #0@N3,C6,N4,C3,C4,C5,N1,C2,N2,C8,O2,C7,O1,C1 #1:427@N1,C2,N3,C4,C5,C6,N7,C8,N9,C10,O11,C12,O13,C14</code>

;Activity 2 - Practising stereo viewing (divergent)

1. open 1bm8

2. preset apply pub 1

3. Turn on depth cueing

4. Tools > Depiction > Rainbow

5. Tools > Viewing Controls > Camera, select "camera mode" as "wall-eye stereo"

6. <span style="color:red">The separation between my pupils is 7 cm.</span> So I will make the separation between the two images about 6 cm.

7. View it as in the instruction in the course material [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-SX-Chimera].

8. It worked like wonders! The 3D view was especially obvious when I rotate the structure with mouse, and when my eyes got tired.

3D image sustained for quite a separation of my eyes from the screen (until I mis-clicked elsewhere and it's all disrupted..)

;Activity 3 - Ramanchandran plot

(Straightforward. In the Model Panel directly)

;Activity 4 - B-factor colouring

Hydrogens by default is coloured with the lowest B-factor (blue)?!

[[File:bfactor_render.png|500px]]

;Activity 5 - Viewing coulombic surface

(Viewing Panel will be my best friend)

[[File:coulombic_mbp1.png|500px]]

;Activity 6 - Is the sequence in Chimera implicit or explicit?

1. open 1bm8

2. File > Save PDB, call it "1bm8_Q1A.pdb"

3. Delete the following lines:
 ATOM      6  CG  GLN A   4      -0.797   3.008  17.820  1.00 57.21           C
 ATOM      7  CD  GLN A   4      -0.029   2.066  18.730  1.00 60.18           C
 ATOM      8  OE1 GLN A   4       1.135   2.325  19.071  1.00 61.12           O
 ATOM      9  NE2 GLN A   4      -0.673   0.970  19.131  1.00 61.27           N
 ATOM     13 HE21 GLN A   4      -0.200   0.339  19.714  1.00  0.00           H
 ATOM     14 HE22 GLN A   4      -1.594   0.835  18.832  1.00  0.00           H

(I think the following lines are not from the sidechain, so I retained them)
 ATOM     10  H1  GLN A   4      -1.493   5.767  14.644  1.00  0.00           H
 ATOM     11  H2  GLN A   4      -0.148   4.764  14.393  1.00  0.00           H
 ATOM     12  H3  GLN A   4      -1.618   4.097  14.918  1.00  0.00           H

4. Rename the first residue GLN to ALA

5. Save and load in Chimera. Check with Favorites > Sequence

6. The first residue is denoted as "A". '''Therefore the residue identities in the Sequence tool is IMPLICIT!'''

===5.2.1 PDB files===
*flat file (no inherent indexing structure), column-formatted

;HEADER, COMPND, SOURCE: identity of the structure

;SEQRES: explicit sequence, the PDB-sequence for database searches, in the material the experimentalist actually worked with
:* not to be confused with implicit sequence, which is the sequence as registered with coordinates (can have unmodelled parts missing)

;Insertion codes: 
:* Sometimes a sequence number will be followed by a capital letter (e.g. 23 followed by 23A). This is used in sequences that are longer than other homologous counterparts.
:* Used to maintain common numbering scheme within a homologous family

;ATOM: protein or nucleic acids

;HETATM: ligands, cofactors, solvents

;Occupancy: fraction of sites that are occupied by that atom (often seen as 1.0, but modelled coordinates without experimental support have occupancy of 0.0)

;B-factor: thermal fluctuation of atoms related to mean coord displacement if fluctuations are isotropic
:* <math>B = 8\pi^2 <\mathbf{x}^2></math>
:* Often hard to interpret because of anisotropic fluctuation of atoms, poor crystals etc. But generally confidence of position?

;For biological inferences, make sure to distinguish whether we are looking at asymmetric unit or biological unit! It's also not always obvious whether symmetry is induced by crystallization.

===5.2.2 Alternative structural services===
;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/MMDB/mmdb.shtml MMDB]: a structural database by NCBI

;[http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/ Nucleic Acid Structural Database (NDB)]

;[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?pdbcode=index.html PDBsum]: secondary database by EBI. Has analysis and interpretation information

===5.2.3 Navigation of RCSB PDB website===
;Objective: get more familiar with RCSB PDB

1. Search Mbp1

2. Found 3 entries for the ''S. cerevisiae'' Mbp1 protein (keyword search IS indeed bad..):
:* PDB codes: 1BM8, 1MB1, 1L3G

3. Navigate the entry 1BM8:
:* Can download PDB-file or biological assembly?!
:* Protein feature view shows domain topology
:* In this example, asymmetric unit is the biological assembly

4. Go to "3D View": as expected, the core of the protein is mainly hydrophobic

5. Go to "Annotations": Search parameters = CathTree Search for Mlu1-box Binding Protein; DNA-binding Domain (3.10.260)
:* There are currently 6 entries in PDB with this domain/fold (including 1BM8)

6. Go to "Sequence": can annotate sequence with DSSP secondary structure propensities and annotate domains

7. Go to "Sequence Similarity": self-explanatory, basically BLAST-like?

8. Go to "Structural Similarity":
:* determined by jFATCAT-rigid algorithm? [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/structureCluster.do?structureId=1BM8]
:* Has P-value, RMSD, Score, percent identiy, Cov? (probably described in the publication above)
:* Clicking entries under "Domain 2" will go to the same type of page but for this new domain
:* Clicking "view" under "Results" gives a lot more functionalities worth exploring. Related to structural alignments.

9. Go to "Experiment": can find experimental details of structural determination for this entry.

===5.1.1 Abstraction and storage===
;Structures are time-averaged and population-averaged.

;Computable abstraction of structure:
:* coordinates
:* chemical types (e.g. atom types)

;Quality metrics:
:* resolution
:* R-work, R-free
:* bond length and angle deviations
:* coordinate error (e.g. from diffraction data)

;Choosing the right structural model for analyses:
:* Quality of the dataset (raw data) and model-building (overfitting based on R-ratios)
:* Method of structure determination
:* Experimental conditions (native environment?)
:* Model completeness (fewer missing segments)
:* When making inferences about related proteins, the sequence similarity is important
:* Space group and crystal contacts
:* When analysis pertains to ligand binding, the holo structures would be desirable

===5.1.2 Visualization and interpretation===
;Types of tructure representation depends on purpose.

;Stereo view! Trick my eyes into seeing 3D with left and right images?

;Interpretation: structure as collection of features
