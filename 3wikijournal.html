=3 Basic Bioinformatics=
==3.1 Motivation==
===3.1.1 Molecular biology can be understood in terms of information flow===
;Dogma:
: DNA sequences --> protein structure --> protein interactions & assembly --> functional circuits of biological systems

;However, we seem to not be able to deterministically infer higher level information from lower level at each step.
: What's getting in the way -- '''incomplete information'''

===3.1.2 Funfamental task: Data management===
* Amount of biological data is huge
* The field is evolving '''very rapidly'''
* Need to make things query-able
* Many challenges: data & service overload, poor integration ...

===3.1.2 Funfamental task: Modelling===
* "Data alone does not explain itself." (B. Steipe)
* It's often not entirely clear what are the best data resources, best analysis tools or services. Again, things go outdated very fast, and it's not often not straightforward to compare resources [insight!]
* This necessitates that bioinformatics is not just about data itself. Bioinformatics aims to contribute to the understanding of biology through modelling.
* This necessitates focusing on objectives rather than methodology.
* Activities have to turn into better understanding. Otherwise, it would just be cargo cult [insight!].

==3.2 Information Sources for Bioinformatics==

;Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops: https://bioinformatics.ca/
:* Workshops, many learning resources

;International Society for Computational Biology: http://iscb.org

;Journals
:* ''Bioinformatics''
:* ''Nucleic Acids Research'' (It has a really nice current database volume and a Web service volume for each year. 2019 Check out: EncoMPASS<ref>EncoMPASS: an online database for analyzing structure and symmetry in membrane proteins</ref>, The MemProtMD database</ref>The MemProtMD database: a resource for membrane-embedded protein structures and their lipid interactions</ref>)
:* ''BMC Bioinformatics''
:* ''PLoS Computational Biology''

 For each bioinformatics resources/services, look for:
 1. what to expect with such resources and 
 2. how to use the services
