===3.1.1 Molecular biology can be understood in terms of information flow===
;Dogma:
: DNA sequences --> protein structure --> protein interactions & assembly --> functional circuits of biological systems

;However, we seem to not be able to deterministically infer higher level information from lower level at each step.
: What's getting in the way -- '''incomplete information'''

===3.1.2 Funfamental task: Data management===
* Amount of biological data is huge
* The field is evolving '''very rapidly'''
* Need to make things query-able
* Many challenges: data & service overload, poor integration ...

===3.1.2 Funfamental task: Modelling===
* "Data alone does not explain itself." (B. Steipe)
* It's often not entirely clear what are the best data resources, best analysis tools or services. Again, things go outdated very fast, and it's not often not straightforward to compare resources [insight!]
* This necessitates that bioinformatics is not just about data itself. Bioinformatics aims to contribute to the understanding of biology through modelling.
* This necessitates focusing on objectives rather than methodology.
* Activities have to turn into better understanding. Otherwise, it would just be cargo cult [insight!].

==3.2 Information Sources for Bioinformatics==

;Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops: https://bioinformatics.ca/
:* Workshops, many learning resources

;International Society for Computational Biology: http://iscb.org

;Journals

:* ''Bioinformatics''
:* ''Nucleic Acids Research'' (It has a really nice current database volume and a Web service volume for each year. 2019 Check out: EncoMPASS<ref>EncoMPASS: an online database for analyzing structure and symmetry in membrane proteins</ref>, The MemProtMD database<ref>The MemProtMD database: a resource for membrane-embedded protein structures and their lipid interactions</ref>)
:* ''BMC Bioinformatics''
:* ''PLoS Computational Biology''

 For each bioinformatics resources/services, look for:
 1. what to expect with such resources and 
 2. how to use the services

==2.9 Final Notes on Coding Style==
;General principles: clarity, readability, don't get witty, generality, explicitly (ok, the last two are kind of a stretch with the rhyme)

;Comments: Use LOTS of comments. Not just what but also why. Indent to format nicely.

;Headers, separators, and always end your code with an # [END] comment

;def GLOBAL_VARIABLES at the beginning

;'''options()''': set truly global options

;Use <package>::<function>() over library() (explicit)

;Do not mess with the global state

;Try to always else the if statement

;set.seed() to allow reproducible results from codes involving random processes for debugging purposes.
:* set.seed(NULL) to re-initiate with a new seed

==2.8 Plotting==
;Plenty of examples [http://www.r-graph-gallery.com here].

;The power of visualization: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/

===2.8.1 Helpful plotting related functions===
;summary(x)

;quantile(x, probs=<vector>): returns quantiles of the sample x. Specific quantile percentages can be specified in probs=<vector>.

;Sampling from a distribution: rnorm(), runif(), ...

;Built-in plotting functions:
:* plot(): scatter plot
:* rug(): add rugs onto the axes (visually show data distributions)
:* hist(): histogram
:* barplot(): bar graph
:* boxplot(): box-plot
:* stripchart(): (sort of like) 1D scatter plot

;For more: "plottingIntro.R" (B.Steipe)

;QQ-plot assessing normality assumption (by comparing the quantiles between theoretical and sample): qqnorm(), qqline()
:* If two samples are supplied as arguments, these functions also compare the two distributions.

===2.8.2 General principles===
;All plot elements are necessary (no unhelpful redundancy), informative presentation, all information in data displayed

;Plot tells a story: relationships, significance, and insufficiencies converyed by the data -> Not to mislead

;Basic syntax (assigning function to an object name<function_name>): <code><function_name> <- function(<arguments>) {<commands>}</code>
:* May have <code>return()</code> statement in <commands>

;An example of function: seq()
: Ways to pass arguments: <code>seq(-5,3)</code>, <code>seq(from=-2, to=2, by=1/3)</code>, <code>seq(length.out=30, to=100, from=1)</code>
: Named arguments don't assume default order when passing with explicit argument names.

;Read about a function's explicit code by typing it out and <enter>. 

;S3 methods?? (back to this later) <code>method(<function>); getAnywhere(<an_item_in_methods_of_the_function>)</code>

;Primitive (compiled in C)

===2.6.1 R Commands that may be helpful and used often===
;is.character(), is.factor(), is.integer(), is.sorted(), is.null(), is.numeric(), is.vector(): (self-explanatory)
<span style="color:red">Some behaviours I noticed to watch out for:</span>
<source lang="R">
is.integer(3) #FALSE
is.integer(3L) #TRUE
is.vector(3) #TRUE
</source>

;exists(<object>): returns TRUE if the <object> is defined.
:* <object> is a string of the name of variable to be questioned![https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28218508/r-check-if-r-object-exists-before-creating-it]

;Some string methods:
:* '''nchar(<string>)''': returns the number of characters in <string>
:* '''substr(<string>, start, end)''': slice string from <code>start</code> to <code>end</code> (inclusive). The slice can be re-assigned as a way to change <string>.
:* '''paste(..., sep=" ", collapse=NULL)''': concatenate strings in ... and separate them by sep string. '''If vector of strings argument is given, it will return vector of concat strings unless collapse is not NULL.
<source lang="R">
paste(c("a", "b"), c("c", "d"), sep="?", collapse="!") #gives one string: "a?c!b?d"
</source>

;Boolean operators <code>"&&"</code> and <code>"||"</code>:
:* <code>"&"</code> and <code>"|"</code> will give vectorized booleans, whereas <code>"&&"</code> and <code>"||"</code> give single booleans
:* <code>"&&"</code> will start out TRUE, and stop evaluating when the first FALSE is encountered.
:* <code>"||"</code> will start out FALSE, and stop evaluating when the first TRUE is encountered.

===2.6.2 If statements===
;Basic syntax: <code>if (<condition1>) {<command1>}; else if (<condition2>) {<command2>}; else {<command3>}</code>

;ifelse(<condition>, a, b): if <condition> is TRUE, evaluates a and returns a; else, evaluates b and returns b.
:* '''The <condition> can be vectorized, resulting in a vector of a's and b's'''

===2.6.3 For loops===
;Basic syntax: <code>for (<item> in <vector>); {<command>}</code>

;Some pointers:
:* Try to use vectorized operations instead of loops if possible.
:* '''seq_along(x)''': Try to always use this to prevent 1:0 type error...

===2.6.4 While loops===
;Basic syntax: <code>while (<condition>); {<command>}</code>

===2.6.5 Activities===
;A rocket ship has to sequence a countdown for the rocket to launch...

===2.5.1 R Commands that may be helpful and used often===
(aka tips I got from "subsettingPractice.R" by B. Steipe)

;sort(x): returns a vector that's x but sorted (from smallest to largest)

;order(x): returns the indices of the elements in x if sorted (useful in subsetting)

;apply(x, <margin>, <function>): apply <function> to all margins of vector-like x. e.g. <margin>=1 would be rows if x is a matrix.

;any(<boolean_vector>): returns TRUE if any of the element in <boolean_vector> is TRUE (<code>|</code> all elements)

;all(<boolean_vector>): returns TRUE if all of the element in <boolean_vector> is TRUE (<code>&</code> all elements)

;grep(<pattern>, x): (might end up being my favourite function) returns indices of elements in x that matches <pattern> '''(supports regex!)'''

;which(<boolean_vector>): returns a vector of indices at which <boolean_vector> is TRUE.

;unique(x): returns a vector of unique elements of x

;duplicated(x): returns a boolean vector. For all positions at which duplication occurs, the element is TRUE.

;<code>%in%</code>: operator &isin

;Can combine boolean vectors with boolean operators when subsetting

;Obviously list is much more versatile and flexible than vectors or data frames (any number of arbitrary types).

===2.4.1 R Commands that may be helpful and used often===
;list(): create a list
:* <name>=<item>: the list will be named this way with <item> having name <name>

;strsplit(<x>, <split>): split string <x> into a list through split markers <split>

;lapply(<x>, <function>): apply <function>(function) iteratively over the list/vector <x>

;unlist(<x>): flattens a list (simplifies <x> to a vector of its atomic components)

===2.4.2 Methods of lists===
;Access the list items:
:* by index (e.g. <code><nowiki>list[[1]]</nowiki></code>) <span style="color:red">'''Double brackets!'''</span>
:* if the list is named, access by name via $ (e.g. <code>list$firstItem</code>) or double brackets (e.g. <code><nowiki>list[[firstItem]]</nowiki></code>)

; Manipulate some lists of plasmid information:
<source lang="R">
#source("R_Exercise-BasicSetup.R")
#init()

pUC19 <- list(size=2686, marker="ampicillin", ori="ColE1", accession="L01397", BanI=c(235, 408, 550, 1647) ) #pUC19 info

(pACYC184 <- list(size=4245, marker=c("Tet", "Cam"), ori="p15A")) #Create a list like with data for pACYC184

plasmidDB <- list()
plasmidDB[["pUC19"]] <- pUC19 #Make a data bank list of plasmids and add pUC19 to it
plasmidDB[["pACYC184"]] <- pACYC184 #Add pACYC184 to it

pBR322 <- list(size=4361, marker=c("Amp", "Tet"), ori="ColE1") #Create a list like with data for pBR322
plasmidDB[["pBR322"]] <- pBR322 #Add pBR322 to it

plasmidDB$pACYC184 #Retrieve the entire pACYC184 list

sizes <- lapply(plasmidDB, function(x) { return(x$size) }) #Get sizes

===2.3.1 R Commands that may be helpful and used often===
;read.table(<path>): load data set as data frame.
:* sep=<separation>(string): separations used in <path> data file. e.g. <code>"\t"</code> for tab in R.
:* header=<boolean>: indicate whether the data file contains variable names as its first line.
:* stringAsFactors=<boolean>: Usually turn this off unless I want to as.factor() all the strings.
   
;data.frame(...): create a data frame. ... in <column_name>=<values> format.
:* row.names=NULL: can specify row names here. The default is NULL.


===2.3.2 Methods for Data frames===
:* Renaming rows/Using a column as row names by assigning directly to its row names: <code>rownames(df) <- df[,1] #First column as row names</code>
:* Same rules for retrieving & removing rows/columns as matrices, with the added feature of retrieving by row/column names.
:* rbind() and cbind() should also work for data frames.

</div>

===2.2.1 R Commands that may be helpful and used often===
;'''objectInfo(<object>): (specially defined function only in R_Exercise-BasicSetup.R): After init(), this function is defined and it returns mode(), typeof(), and class() of the <code><object></code>'''
;It also gives data structure of the object?

;seq(from, to, by): Generates a sequence

;summary(x): summary of x=<object> (e.g. If x is a vector, then it returns basic statistics on this vector such as mean, median etc.)


===2.2.2 Scalars ===
;single valued, but by construction, it's also a vector of length of 1
: e.g. length() and indexing will work

;Objects can have mode, type, and class.

;Important notes:
:* ;An (apparent) integer is by default a double-precision float! To get integer type and class, one has to have <code><integer>L</code>. An alternative is to coerce it into an integer.
:* ;However, integers obtained from range operators (e.g. <code>1:10</code>, which returns a vector) are actual integers!
:* <span style="color:red">'''R indexing starts at 1!!!'''</span>

;Coercion:
:* The names of functions are self-explanatory. Check with objectInfo() if needed: '''as.numeric(), as.character(), as.complex()'''
:* Note that as.numeric("pi") is silly and won't work -- It gives NA (<code>objectInfo(NA)</code> indicates <code>NA</code> is of mode logical, type logical, and class logical)
:* as.logical(x) will return FALSE if x == 0, elif it will return TRUE if x != 0 and x is numeric, else (e.g. if x is a string) will return NA.
:* <code>NaN</code> means "not a number", though it is of mode numeric, type double, and class numeric. '''<code>as.logical(NaN)</code> returns NA.'''
:* <code>NULL</code> means "nothing" or "undefined". It is of mode NULL, type NULL, and class NULL (basically just nothing). e.g. <code>as.logical(NULL)</code> will be the same as <code>as.logical()</code>
:* '''as.factor(x)''' encodes vector x as factor? (back to this later)


===2.2.3 Vectors===
;An ordered array of objects of the same type

;A general way to generate a vector: c() (link to the function on this page?)

;Subsetting:
:* Indexing: e.g. x[1:10], x[5:1], x[seq(1,10,2)]
:* <span style="color:red">'''Negative indices deserves a special note for R'''</span>: the negative indices are the ones to be omitted.
:* Boolean filtering: e.g. x[x>3]
:* If <code>length(<logical_vector>) < length(<vector>)</code>, the <logical_vector> filter will be re-applied in cyclically on <vector>.
:* Indexing by name if it's a named array: e.g. <code>summary(x)[c("Max.", "Min.")]</code>
:* Retrieve names of a named vector using '''names(x)'''

;Extending:
:* Extending a vector by simply assign a value to a vector index larger than its length: e.g. <code>x[4] <- 4</code> works even if <code>length(x) < 4</code> before assignment.

;Many operations on vectors are by default vectorized! (just like NumPy)
:* Similar behaviour to cyclic boolean filtering, if the two vectors on which the operator acts on have different lengths... e.g. <code>(1:10)*(1:5)</code> is the same as <code>(1:10)/rep(1:5,2)</code>


===2.2.4 Matrices and Tensors?===
;Ways to make a matrix
1) To turn a 1-D vector into a matrix/tensor <array>, assign a vector of dimensions to dim(<array>) (e.g. <code>dim(a) <- c(x, y)</code>; the behaviour is similar to numpy.array.reshape() in Python)

2) Use '''matrix()''' or '''array()'''

3) Using '''rbind(...)''' (row bind) or '''cbind(...)''' (column bind)

;dim(a): dimensions of matrix a.
:* if <code>class(a) != "matrix"</code>, <code>dim(a)</code> will return <code>NULL</code>

;<code>nrow(a) == dim(a)[1]; ncol(a) == dim(a)[2]</code>, ... (slice follows at position 3 of dim(a) for a 3-D array)

; Note that unlike numpy.array subsetting, a comma must be given to the subset index of an R-array to retrieve an entire indexed row. For example:
<source lang="R">
a <- 1:12
dim(a) <- c(2,6)

a[1] #This should give 1, the first element
a[1,] #This should give the first row vector, 1:6

a[6] #Without comma, it takes the element at position 6 as if a is a linearized vector

===R Commands that may be helpful and used often===
;c(...): concatenates values into a vector (will coerce values into the same type)

;tail(<object>, ...): get the last part of <code><object></code>
:* n=<integer>: get the last <code><integer></code> of <code><object></code>
:* An analogous function: head()

;sample(x, size, replace=FALSE, prob=NULL): randomly sample from elements of <code>x</code>
:* if <code>x</code> is a single numeric >= 1, sample <code>1:x</code> ''(R syntax: <code>x:y</code> means x to y '''inclusive''')''
:* replace=<boolean>: with or without replacement?
:* prob=<vector>: a vector of probability weights


===R syntax practice===
<source lang="R">
numbers <- c(16, 20, 3, 5, 9)
lastnum <- tail(numbers, 1)

(lastnum < 6) | (lastnum > 10) #To check whether lastNum is less than 6 or greater than 10

(lastnum >= 10) & (lastnum < 20) #To check whether lastNum is in the interval [10, 20)

(((((lastnum / 7)*10 - (((lastnum / 7)*10) %/% 1)) / 10) * 100) %/% 1) ^ (1/3) #To output TRUE if the following operation gives 2

#COUNTER-INTUITIVE/STRANGE BEHAVIOUR!!! (lastnum / 7)*10 %/% 1 does not do what I expect it to do
#It does 10 %/% 1 first
#Weird that integer division, while is sort of division, takes priority?
</source>

<span style="color:red"><code>(lastnum / 7)*10 %/% 1</code> does not do what I expect it to do</span>

<span style="color:red">I have to do <code>((lastnum / 7)*10) %/% 1</code></span>

<span style="color:red">Weird that integer division, while is sort of division, takes priority?</span>


===Notes on Variables===
;Can make use of <code>make.names</code> to make syntactically valid variable names from character vectors. See <code>?make.names for more</code>.

;Reserved words for R-parser can be seen in <code>?reserved</code> (e.g. <code>TRUE <- 3</code> won't work)

;Do not re-assign <code>pi</code>!!! Unfortunately it doesn't throw an error.


===Syntax features===
;Just like python, arithmetics in R does not seem to be sensitive to (number of) spaces.

;Unlike python:
:* Booleans (TRUE or FALSE) are case sensitive (RStudio autocorrects)
:* Exponentiation: <code>^</code> (turns out <code>**</code> also works in R)
:* Mod: <code>%%</code>
:* Integer division: <code>%/%</code>
:* Does not support "and" or "or". Only <code>&</code> or <code>|</code>

===Playing with dataset seqinr::aaindex===
;;Seems like we retieve entries of data in the dataset via some rather arbitrary name?

<source lang="R">
?seqinr::aaindex
#This can tell me the following line, which lets me know the index and the name of the data entry
#It also tells me what $H, $J etc. mean when I display a data entry (the third line)

which(sapply(aaindex, function(x) length(grep("Kyte", x$A)) != 0)) #grep() is probably regex filter

aaindex$FASG890101
</source>


===Plot sample data===
<source lang="R">
plot(aaindex$FASG890101$I,
     aaindex$PONJ960101$I,
     xlab="hydrophobicity", ylab="volume", type="n")
text(aaindex$FASG890101$I,
     aaindex$PONJ960101$I,
     labels=a(names(aaindex$FASG890101$I)))
</source>

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:90%; margin-left: 10px; padding-right: 15px">
<span style="color:red">'''''Error message'''''</span>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<code>Error in a(names(aaindex$FASG890101$I)) : could not find function "a"</code>

Also: there is nothing in the plot. I suspect it doesn't like a or aaindex
</div>
</div>

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:90%; margin-left: 10px; padding-right: 15px">
<span style="color:green">'''''Solution'''''</span>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Explicitly define <code>seqinr::a</code> and rerun the script resolves the problem.

Turns out <code>aaindex</code> has no problem, as it has already been loaded.

If <code>library(seqinr)</code> was run ahead of time, the original code should work.
</div>
</div>


===Some useful "punchline" codes===
;Avoid error by installing a package if not already installed
<source lang="R">
if (! requireNamespace("seqinr", quietly=TRUE)) {
    install.packages("seqinr")
    }
#requireNamespace(): returns TRUE is installed and vice versa

if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()
#Bioconductor packages are installed a bit differently

#Packages neither CRAN or Bioconductor: devtools (but the link on the course website is broken)
</source>

;sos package will help me find packages
