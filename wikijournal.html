;Commands that may be helpful and used often
* library():
;;When no arguments given: list of installed package
;;argument=<package>: load <package> (not string! no quotes!)
;;help=<package>: doc for <package>
* data():
;;When no arguments given, list of available data sets
;;argument=<dataset>: load dataset <dataset>
;;package=<package>: load/list dataset(s) in <package>
* search(): list of currently loaded packages
* vignette(): (also doc for a package?)
* Get help by preceding function, package, or library name with ?
* Get help by preceding function, package, or library name with ?? if I have approximate impression for the name of it (e.g. ?aaindex will not work but ??aaindex will work)
* s2c(string): convert string into vector of constituent characters

; Playing with dataset seqinr::aaindex
;;Seems like we retieve entries of data in the dataset via some rather arbitrary name?

<source lang="R">
    ?seqinr::aaindex #This can tell me the following line, which lets me know the index and the name of the data entry; it also tells me what $H, $J etc. mean when I display a data entry (the third line)
    which(sapply(aaindex, function(x) length(grep("Kyte", x$A)) != 0)) #grep() is probably regex

;;Plot sample data:
plot(aaindex$FASG890101$I,
     aaindex$PONJ960101$I,

        Error in a(names(aaindex$FASG890101$I)) : could not find function "a"

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
    Resolution
        <div class="mw-collapsible-content">
        Explicitly define seqinr::a and rerun the script.

        aaindex has no problem, as it has already been loaded.

        If library(seqinr) was run ahead of time, the original code should work.
        </div>
</div>

;Avoid error by installing a package if not already installed.
<source lang="R">
    if (! requireNamespace("seqinr", quietly=TRUE)) {
        install.packages("seqinr")
      }
    #requireNamespace(): returns TRUE is installed and vice versa

    if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
    BiocManager::install()
    #Bioconductor packages are installed a bit differently

    #Packages neither CRAN or Bioconductor: devtools (but the link on the course website is broken)

=='''''0.2 Plagiarism and Academic Integrity'''''==

===Objective===
: Avoid academic offense and abide courteous academic culture.

===Full Disclosure Policy===
* Anything idea that's not my own has a source that needs to be referenced.
* You can never have too many references.
* APA citation format
* The code should produce the exact results claimed. Otherwise: falsified results
* Reference by commenting in R-code

===Conclusion===

When in doubt, reference it or consult [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Wiki_editing this page].

===Progress===

;Activity 1
* Procedure: concise but sufficient so that it's reproducible
* Results: static data, variable data, analysis results

;Activity 2
* Cross-referencing with anchors
* Images: compressed; stereo views for images of molecules; should convey what I'm trying to show effectively
* Here's the R-code
