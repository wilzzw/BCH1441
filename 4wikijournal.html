=4 Concepts in Biology=
==4.1 Cell Cycle==
;Universally conserved process for cell division involving many regulatory protein machineries.
:* In fact, they are so highly conserved that many machineries work just fine when expressed in a different species<ref>Molecular Biology of the Cell</ref>

===4.1.1 Phases of cell cycle===
;Interphase: cell growth and chromosomal DNA replication. Makes up the majority of the cell cycle duration
:* ;G1: cell growth pre-replication
:* ;S-phase: cell becomes committed to and prepares for division. DNA-replication and centrosome replication
:* ;G2: cell growth after DNA-replication and prior to mitosis

;Mitotic phase (M-phase): mitosis and cytokinesis. Actual events of cell division.
* ;Mitosis (nuclear division)
:* ;Prophase: nucleolus disappears and chromosomes form from chromatin condensation
:* ;Pro-metaphase: centrosomes move apart and polarize. Nuclear membrane disappears
:* ;Metaphase: chromosomes line up along the equator (metaphase plate)
:* ;Anaphase: centromeres break down and chromosomes separate. Sister chromatids move to opposite poles
:* ;Telophase: new nuclei re-form
* ;Cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division)

;Resting Phase: an off-cycle phase (or G0 phase)

===4.1.2 Key players in G1/S transition===
;Once going into the S-phase, the cell is committed to divide.
