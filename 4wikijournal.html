=4 Concepts in Biology=
==4.1 Cell Cycle==
;Universally conserved process for cell division involving many regulatory protein machineries.
:* In fact, they are so highly conserved that many machineries work just fine when expressed in a different species<ref>Molecular Biology of the Cell</ref>

===4.1.1 Phases of cell cycle===
;Interphase: cell growth and chromosomal DNA replication. Makes up the majority of the cell cycle duration
:* '''G1''': cell growth pre-replication
:* '''S-phase''': cell becomes committed to and prepares for division. DNA-replication and centrosome replication
:* '''G2''': cell growth after DNA-replication and prior to mitosis

;Mitotic phase (M-phase): mitosis and cytokinesis. Actual events of cell division.
* '''Mitosis''' (nuclear division)
:* '''Prophase''': nucleolus disappears and chromosomes form from chromatin condensation
:* '''Pro-metaphase''': centrosomes move apart and polarize. Nuclear membrane disappears
:* '''Metaphase''': chromosomes line up along the equator (metaphase plate)
:* '''Anaphase''': centromeres break down and chromosomes separate. Sister chromatids move to opposite poles
:* '''Telophase''': new nuclei re-form
* '''Cytokinesis''' (cytoplasmic division)

;Resting Phase (G0 phase): an off-cycle phase

===4.1.2 Key players in G1/S transition===
;Once going into the S-phase, the cell is committed to divide.

;SBF(transcription factor):
:* Constituents: Swi4 (DNA-binding) + Swi6
:* Binds promoter of SCB elements expressed at START

;MBF (transcription factor):
:* Constituents: Mbp1 (DNA-binding) + Swi6
:* Binds promoter of MCB elements expressed at START

;Whi5/Nrm1: repress G1/S transition expression by binding Swi6 C-terminus through a conserved '''GTB motif'''.
