;Objective: Review some prob distribution concepts by running through FND-STA-Probability_distribution.R

;Useful functions:
:* plotrix::multhist(): multiply-stacked histogram
:* cut(x, breaks=n): cut a numeric vector x into n parts and convert to factors. Great for converting numerical data into categorical data.

;install.packages("plotrix")

===4.3.1 Probability functions in R: utilities===
* d...: value of p.d.f. at a given outcome x value
* p...: cumulative probability up to x
* q...: value of x at which the given quantile cut-off occurs
* r...: randomly sample from a probability distribution

===4.3.2 Some important distributions===
;Poisson distribution: pois(n, p)
:* n: number of occurance
:* p: average probability of occurance

;Uniform distribution: unif(from, to)
:* often useful for Monte-Carlo simulation methods of estimation

;Normal distribution: norm(mean, var)
:* Central Limit Theorem (CLT): averages of samples drawn from distributions tend to follow Normal Distribution

===4.3.3 Quantile analyses===
Line 260-286:
CLT observation - It appears that the larger the sample size is for the sampling from distribution, the means follow Normal Distribution more closely.

===4.3.4 Chi-sq test for comparing discrete distributions===
;Reminder of what chi-sq test does:
R-code line <code>View(rbind(as.vector(countsL1),as.vector(countsL2)))</code>

Null hypothesis is that the distribution among V's is independent of the rows (1 or 2).

Chi-sq metric is related to the sum of squares of each rows values of V's difference from the averages of V's. Larger the value the less likely the independence. [http://www.r-tutor.com/elementary-statistics/goodness-fit/chi-squared-test-independence]

[[File:chi-sq_table.png|500px]]

In R: chisq.test()
:* <code>simulate.p.value = TRUE</code> seems like a good idea?
:* B: number of replicates for simulate.p.value

[https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/113692/test-identicality-of-discrete-distributions For comparing discrete distributions, there are important caveats!]

===4.3.5 Kullback-Leibler divergence/relative entropy method for comparing discrete distributions===
Compare bt two inputs of probability mass functions.

<code>sum(log(p / q))</code>

where p and q are two probability mass functions (in terms of vectors)

;To see what an obtained value means, can draw a number of random samples from the distribution q and compare the KL value for that against KL value of p.

;One caution about probability mass functions obtained from frequencies from simulations: by random chance if certain outcomes were not sampled at all will be assigned a 0.

Ways to get around it:
:* Probability "bracketing"
:* Adding pseudo-counts (e.g. Laplace prior, Jeffreys prior...)

===4.3.6 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for comparing continuous distributions===
Null hypothesis is that two samples were taken from the same distribution.

In R: ks.test()

;To compute probabilities, know:
:* events
:* all possible alternative events

;Approaches to compute probabilities:

1. Closed form expression (e.g. binomial)

2. Enumeration (i.e. list all possible outcomes by judiciously make outcome table or trees. Intuition can be deceptive in many cases!)

3. Simulation (when problem is too complex and large to be tractable by closed form expression or enumeration of outcomes. Furthermore, sometimes whether the assumptions are correct is unclear. But simulation only strictly gives an estimate of real probability?)

A question: If a restriction-endonuclease site is six bases long, how many such sites would you expect in a 3MB long bacterial chromosome with a GC-content of 50%?

 Since GC content is 50%, so is AT content. Base pairing requirement implies that the probability of a base being A, G, C, or T is 25%
 Consider the entire chromosome of length N base pairs to be a series of N-6+1=N-5 slots
 Probability of a slot being the six-base-long restriction site is <math>0.25^6</math>
 I am assuming the identity of a base is independent of what other bases are.
 This is a "with-replacement" assumption that may not actually be true (there is a fixed number of each base)
 However, with 3 million bases, I expect the assumption to be ok
 The probability of having k of such restriction sites would follow a binomial distribution:
            <math>P(k) = \binom{N-5}{k} p^k (1-p)^{(N-5-k)}</math>
 Expectation:
            <math><k> = \sum_{k=0}^{N-5} k P(k)</math>
 I noticed another assumption I made:
 It often may not be possible to have N-5 restriction sites depending on the sequence of restriction site 
 (e.g. GAATTC immediately makes it not possible)
 However, I expect the probability of that to be vanishingly small anyways

R-code to compute the expectation value:
<source lang="R">
N <- 3e6
p <- (1/4)^6
k <- 0:(N-5)
Pk <- dbinom(k, N-5, p)
kAvg <- k * Pk # I get an average of 732.4207 restriction sites
</source>

;Universally conserved process for cell division involving many regulatory protein machineries.
:* In fact, they are so highly conserved that many machineries work just fine when expressed in a different species<ref>Molecular Biology of the Cell</ref>

===4.1.1 Phases of cell cycle===
;Interphase: cell growth and chromosomal DNA replication. Makes up the majority of the cell cycle duration
:* '''G1''': cell growth pre-replication
:* '''S-phase''': cell becomes committed to and prepares for division. DNA-replication and centrosome replication
:* '''G2''': cell growth after DNA-replication and prior to mitosis

;Mitotic phase (M-phase): mitosis and cytokinesis. Actual events of cell division.
* '''Mitosis''' (nuclear division)
:* '''Prophase''': nucleolus disappears and chromosomes form from chromatin condensation
:* '''Pro-metaphase''': centrosomes move apart and polarize. Nuclear membrane disappears
:* '''Metaphase''': chromosomes line up along the equator (metaphase plate)
:* '''Anaphase''': centromeres break down and chromosomes separate. Sister chromatids move to opposite poles
:* '''Telophase''': new nuclei re-form
* '''Cytokinesis''' (cytoplasmic division)

;Resting Phase (G0 phase): an off-cycle phase

===4.1.2 Key players in G1/S transition===
;Once going into the S-phase, the cell is committed to divide.

;SBF(transcription factor):
:* Constituents: Swi4 (DNA-binding) + Swi6
:* Binds promoter of SCB elements expressed at START

;MBF (transcription factor):
:* Constituents: Mbp1 (DNA-binding) + Swi6
:* Binds promoter of MCB elements expressed at START

;Whi5/Nrm1: repress G1/S transition expression by binding Swi6 C-terminus through a conserved '''GTB motif'''.
