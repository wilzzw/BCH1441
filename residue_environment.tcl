# Idea: read from JSON for each type of residue to decide what kind of atoms to show
# Select a subset of atoms (typically four non-coplanar atoms) for aligning the residues
# This will depend on the residue type specified in $RESIDUE_NAME. Specific atom names to be used for alignment is stored in JSON file "atomsAlign.json"
# Here a package is used to read JSON. It appears that unless I installed tcl/tk properly (not as an extension of VMD), it won't find proper package to read JSON
# So the following steps are needed:

### Step 1: Make a local repository clone of git@github.com:tcltk/tcllib.git (getting the source codes of the package)
### -- e.g. in Linux/Unix (mine is Bash on Ubuntu on Windows):
### -- mkdir tcllib; cd tcllib;
### -- git init; git remote add origin git@github.com:tcltk/tcllib.git;
### -- git pull origin master
###
### Step 2: Add the absolute path to "tcllib/modules/json" to the tcl environment variable $auto_path in VMD
### -- For me, the command line I type in the tcl/tk console of VMD is:
### -- lappend auto_path "C:/Users/Wilson/Documents/BCH1441/tcllib/modules/json"
###
### Step 3: Loading the package json in tcl should work now:
### -- package require json

# Step 2 and 3 have already been implemented in the code right underneath. User has to do Step 1 by themselves and change the path to "json" package accordingly
# I put that in the global variable $tclJsonPATH
set tclJsonPATH "${HOME_PATH}/tcllib/modules/json"
lappend auto_path $tclJsonPATH
package require json

# Function that reads JSON files
# Argument: jsonName: JSON file name with extension .json
