===5.1.1 Abstraction and storage===
;Structures are time-averaged and population-averaged.

;Computable abstraction of structure:
:* coordinates
:* chemical types (e.g. atom types)

;Quality metrics:
:* resolution
:* R-work, R-free
:* bond length and angle deviations
:* coordinate error (e.g. from diffraction data)

;Choosing the right structural model for analyses:
:* Quality of the dataset (raw data) and model-building (overfitting based on R-ratios)
:* Method of structure determination
:* Experimental conditions (native environment?)
:* Model completeness (fewer missing segments)
:* When making inferences about related proteins, the sequence similarity is important
:* Space group and crystal contacts
:* When analysis pertains to ligand binding, the holo structures would be desirable

===5.1.2 Visualization and interpretation===
;Types of tructure representation depends on purpose.

;Stereo view! Trick my eyes into seeing 3D with left and right images?

;Interpretation: structure as collection of features
