;Step 1 - Target Sequence

1. Fetch the APSES doamin sequence for MBP1_ERECY. [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/students/index.php/User:Zhi_Wei_Zeng/Journal#5.9.1_Construct_homology_model_for_ERECY_Mbp1 I have already done this in my journal]

2. The sequence is:
 "QIYSAKYSGVEVYEFIHPTGSIMKRKADDWVNATHILKAAKFAKAKRTRILEKEVIKDIHEKVQGGFGKYQGTWVPLDIARRLAEKFDVLEELRPLFDF"

;Step 2 - Template Structure and create alignment

3. From my past activity, I already had the sequence corresponding to PDB 4UX5 stored in "4UX5_A.fa".

4. Use the R-code provided [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-SX-Homology_modelling#The_input_alignment here] by Dr. Steipe in RStudio with ABC-units project loaded.

Until the line where we are able to inspect the MSA or write to file.

'''Now, I choose 4UX5 as the template. I have to write the alignment to a different file.'''

I may not be able to re-use my old "APSES-MBP1.fa" because <code>fetchMSAmotif(MBP1msa, seq1BM8)</code> would only make sure to cover the sequence for 1BM8 but not necessarily 4UX5.

I follow the following R-code, which really is just a modified version of the code provided to me:

<source lang="R">
# Be careful to not overwrite, though I do have version control..
# My version control is in the directory parent to getwd()
writeMFA(fetchMSAmotif(MBP1msa, seq4UX5), myCon = "../APSES-MBP1_ALT.fa")

myT <- seq4UX5

# Everything below is the same as source code
# The code below has dependency on the variable targetName which I have not defined
# Define it with the following line
(targetName <- sprintf("MBP1_%s", biCode(MYSPE)))

targetSeq   <- as.character(fetchMSAmotif(MBP1msa, myT)[targetName])
templateSeq <- as.character(fetchMSAmotif(MBP1msa, myT)[names(myT)])
 
# Drop positions in which both sequences have hyphens.
targetSeq   <- unlist(strsplit(targetSeq,   ""))
templateSeq <- unlist(strsplit(templateSeq, ""))
gapMask <- ! ((targetSeq == "-") & (templateSeq == "-"))
targetSeq   <- paste0(targetSeq[gapMask], collapse = "")
templateSeq <- paste0(templateSeq[gapMask], collapse = "")
 
# Assemble sequences into a set
TTset <- character()
TTset[1] <- targetSeq
TTset[2] <- templateSeq
names(TTset) <- c(targetName, names(myT))
 
writeMFA(TTset)

</code>

Inspect the MSA result from file "APSES-MBP1_ALT.fa" in JalView:

[[File:jalview_ERECY.jpg]]

I have doubts about multiple sequence alignment in common residues 1-15 and 118-142.

At only a threshold of 20% conservation threshold, these regions still do not have strong colour indication for conservation.

Residues 121-132 looks pretty well aligned though. However, it is not clear how indels at 118-121 should be resolved.

So I decide to remove 1-15 and 118-142 from alignment for modelling (121-132 is honestly hard to let go..).

The resulting alignment stored in "hm_alt.mfa" is the following:

 >MBP1_ERECY
 QIYSAKYSGVEVYEFIHP-TGSIMKRKADDWVNATHILKAAKFAKAKRTRILEKEVIKDIHEKVQ
 GGFGKYQGTWVPLDIARRLAEKFDVLEELRPLFDF

 >4UX5_A
 GIYSATYSGIPVYEYQFGLKEHVMRRRVDDWINATHILKAAGFDKPARTRILEREVQKDQHEKVQ
 GGYGKYQGTWIPLEAGEALAHRNNIFDRLRPIFEF

;Step 3 - Build the model and process PDB

5. Use the above alignment to model at SWISS-MODEL at https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive#alignment

Job report at https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive/8aB2RD/models/

One indel is near the end of a beta-turn, resulting in more uncertainty there locally.

 Statistics: GMQE 0.78, QMEAN -0.47 (good)

6. Download the resulting PDB as "MBP1_ERECY-APSES_alt.pdb".

7. Use the modified source code [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-SX-Homology_modelling#Renumbering_the_model here] to renumber the residues of the model correctly.

Modified code here:
<code>
if (! requireNamespace("bio3d", quietly=TRUE)) {
  install.packages("bio3d")
}
# Package information:
#  library(help = bio3d)       # basic information
#  browseVignettes("bio3d")    # available vignettes
#  data(package = "bio3d")     # available datasets

# Save with a different name
PDB_INFILE      <- "../MBP1_ERECY-APSES_alt.pdb" 
PDB_OUTFILE     <- "../MBP1_ERECY-APSESrenum_alt.pdb"
 
# residue number for the first residue if your template was 4UX5
# should actually be 16 though.
# The first residue aligned to the first residue in the homology model is not 14, due to me editing the multiple sequence alignment
iFirst <- 16  
 
# == Read the MYSPE pdb file
MYSPEmodel <- bio3d::read.pdb(PDB_INFILE) # read the PDB file into a list
 
MYSPEmodel           # examine the information
MYSPEmodel$atom[1,]  # get information for the first atom
 
# Explore ?bio3d::read.pdb and study the examples.
 
# == Modify residue numbers for each atom
resNum <- as.numeric(MYSPEmodel$atom[,"resno"])
resNum
resNum <- resNum - resNum[1] + iFirst  # add offset
MYSPEmodel$atom[ , "resno"] <- resNum   # replace old numbers with new
 
# check result
MYSPEmodel$atom[ , "resno"]
MYSPEmodel$atom[1, ]
 
# == Write output to file
bio3d::write.pdb(pdb = MYSPEmodel, file=PDB_OUTFILE) # An error from the code corrected here
</code>

Now, the numbering corresponds correctly to 4UX5 numbering.

;Step 4 - Visualization and superposition

8. In chimera, open 4ux5. Then, load the homology model I just made.

9. The homology model is already aligned to chain A of 4UX5 pretty well. But still, use "MatchMaker" to align it to chain A of 4UX5.

10. Make a copy of the homology model with "copy/combine" in the "Model Panel". Then, use "MatchMaker" to align replica to chain B of 4UX5.
