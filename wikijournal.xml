;Motivation: make biological inferences from relationship data

===7.1.1 Concepts in graph theory===
;Entities: genes, proteins, regulatory DNA etc. and their attributes (structure, function)

;Relationships: between entities, describe how the entities collaborate. Some attributes: direction, multiplicity

;Entities and relationships among them can be mapped into ''graphs''.

;Graph: a set of '''vertices''' and '''edges''' that relate them

;Tree: a connected graphs without cycles

;Directed acyclic graph (DAG): directed (edges with arrows/directions) but no directed cycles (may or may not have cycles?)

;Random graph: generated by random process
:* e.g. random geometric graph: probability of each edge depends on the geometric distance between the vertices

;Hypergraph: generalization of graphs. An edge can connect multiple vertices. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph] [https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/108064/typesetting-a-directed-hypergraph-in-tikz]

;Bipartite graph: a graph whose vertices can be divided into two ''independent'' sets U and V such that: 1) U & V = empty, and 2) every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph]
:* e.g. metabolic networks (U=metabolites, V=enzymes, edges=binding or catalyzed chemical reactions)
:* Check by ''distance parity''?

;Dual graph: G' is a dual graph of a planar graph G if: 1) G' has a vertex for each planar region of G, and 2) G' has an edge joining two neighboring regions defined by G
:* each of such edge of G' seems to be intersecting and edge of G, making 1-to-1 correspondence?
:* e.g. Voronoi diagram

;De Bruijn graph: directed, labeled, each edge connects nodes whose sequences overlap with one offset of one character

;Euler cycle: the cycle visits all edges and every edge exactly once (e.g. draw a graph in one continuous path without overlapping paths)

;Hamilton cycle: visits every vertex/node exactly once

;Degree of a node: number of edges the node has
:* If the graph is directed, can distinguish between "in-degree" and "out-degree"
:* degree centrality: contribution of degrees of nodes to the shape of the graph

;Scale-free network: one whose degree distribution follows: <math>P(k) \propto k^{-\gamma}</math> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network] [https://mathinsight.org/scale_free_network]
:* <math>\gamma</math> often between 2 and 3
:* It was realized that many biological networks, e.g. metabolic networks, are scale-free <ref>Jeong et al 2000</ref>

;Small-world network: distance D between two randomly chosen nodes scales with network size:
::: <math>D = a + b\log V</math>
(size of a graph/network can be represented by the number of edges E or nodes V)

===7.1.2 Analyzing biological networks: what to look for===
;set measures: size, degree distribution and statistics

;topological measures: shortest path, centrality, diameter, spanning trees, network flow ...
:* A '''path''' is a sequence of adjacent nodes. Two nodes are '''adjacent''' if they are connected by an edge
:* A '''shortest path''' between two nodes has the fewest nodes in the sequence
:* '''Betweeness centrality''': is high for nodes that lie between many other nodes (on the many shortest paths between nodes).
::: <math>C_{ij} = \sum_{{i}\neq{j}\neq{w}} \frac{\sigma_{ij}(w)}{\sigma_{ij}}</math>
:* The '''diameter''' of the graph is the longest shortest path of the graph

;graph motifs: distribution?

;graph clustering: clustering algorithms

;graph statistics: permutation, synthesis

;Computation of shortest paths:
:* '''Dijkstra’s algortihm''' for finding the shortest path between two specified nodes
:* '''Floyd-Warshall algorithm''' for finding all shortest paths between two specified nodes

;modules: within a module of a network, nodes are more connected to each other than to outside the module

;readLines(<path>): read lines from the file specified in <code><path</code> (<code>?readLines</code> says it reads from "connection"?)

;nchar(<string>): returns number of characters in the <code><string></code>

;table(<sequence>) returns a table of amino acid frequencies (<code><sequence></code> should be a vector of amino acid one-letter code strings)
:* Or in general, seems like the argument can be any vector, and it returns a named vector with non-repetitive elements of the argument vector as names and their frequencies as elements

;Computable abstraction of structure:
:* coordinates
:* chemical types (e.g. atom types)

;Quality metrics:
:* resolution
:* R-work, R-free
:* bond length and angle deviations
:* coordinate error (e.g. from diffraction data)

;Choosing the right structural model for analyses:
:* Quality of the dataset (raw data) and model-building (overfitting based on R-ratios)
:* Method of structure determination
:* Experimental conditions (native environment?)
:* Model completeness (fewer missing segments)
:* When making inferences about related proteins, the sequence similarity is important
:* Space group and crystal contacts
:* When analysis pertains to ligand binding, the holo structures would be desirable

;To compute probabilities, know:
:* events
:* all possible alternative events

;Approaches to compute probabilities:

1. Closed form expression (e.g. binomial)

2. Enumeration (i.e. list all possible outcomes by judiciously make outcome table or trees. Intuition can be deceptive in many cases!)

3. Simulation (when problem is too complex and large to be tractable by closed form expression or enumeration of outcomes. Furthermore, sometimes whether the assumptions are correct is unclear. But simulation only strictly gives an estimate of real probability?)

A question: If a restriction-endonuclease site is six bases long, how many such sites would you expect in a 3MB long bacterial chromosome with a GC-content of 50%?

 Since GC content is 50%, so is AT content. Base pairing requirement implies that the probability of a base being A, G, C, or T is 25%
 Consider the entire chromosome of length N base pairs to be a series of N-6+1=N-5 slots
 Probability of a slot being the six-base-long restriction site is <math>0.25^6</math>
 I am assuming the identity of a base is independent of what other bases are.
 This is a "with-replacement" assumption that may not actually be true (there is a fixed number of each base)
 However, with 3 million bases, I expect the assumption to be ok
 The probability of having k of such restriction sites would follow a binomial distribution:
            <math>P(k) = \binom{N-5}{k} p^k (1-p)^{(N-5-k)}</math>
 Expectation:
            <math><k> = \sum_{k=0}^{N-5} k P(k)</math>
 I noticed another assumption I made:
 It often may not be possible to have N-5 restriction sites depending on the sequence of restriction site 
 (e.g. GAATTC immediately makes it not possible)
 However, I expect the probability of that to be vanishingly small anyways

R-code to compute the expectation value:
<source lang="R">
N <- 3e6
p <- (1/4)^6
k <- 0:(N-5)
Pk <- dbinom(k, N-5, p)
kAvg <- k * Pk # I get an average of 732.4207 restriction sites

:* Flat-file formats: store as files and define ad-hoc rules to specify how the lines of files will be parsed (e.g. FASTA, GenbankFF, PDB files)
	'''Documentation, maintenance, and correct parsing is a big problem with the ad-hoc approaches. i.e. everything breaks if the file format changes'''
:* Structured data grammars: language for storing data, with rules for parsing of which parsing code can be produced automatically (e.g. XML, JSON)

;XML:
:* comes with open and end markups with definitions specified in .dtd files (document type definition)
:* R has some XML parsing packages which are preferred over manual parsing with regex

;JSON:
:* Python-dictionary-like, much more human-readable
:* Two types of contents: {objects} and key<nowiki>:</nowiki>value pairs
:* Versatile data types and complexity for values

===3.6.2 Implementation of relational data models===
* Computer file systems (represent the data model in terms of files and directory trees)

* Place into spreadsheets (e.g. CSV), but analyze data by exporting data from CSV into e.g. R data frames

* "Real" databases for large-scale, robust data requirements. (e.g. MySQL, Postgresql, dplyr...)

===3.6.3 Running through BIN-Storing_data.R===
;Useful commands:
:* '''rm()''': remove object from memory
:* '''order(x)''': returns a vector of array indices of x ordered based on the items in x
:* '''file.show(<path>)''': display plain text file specified by <path>(string)
:* '''unlist(<list>)''': flatten/simplify <list> into a vector

;Objectives:
:* Learn how to build a database in R (in terms of a list of data frames)

;Activity 1 - Build a database of philosophers


;Activity 2 - Use JSON to organize database for Mbp1-like proteins
R-package: jsonlite
* Useful functions:
:* '''fromJSON(<path>)''': read and parse from .json file specified by <path>(string) and returns a data frame
:* '''dbSanitizeSequence()''': for parsing. Clean-up and returns a single string of one-letter code protein sequence (all uppercase)
:* '''dbInit()''': generates a list of data frames to represent the relational database

;Activity 3 - Find a protein from MYSPE most similar to Mbp1 to be added to the database

1. To find such protein, BLAST: https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi

2. Protein BLAST

3. Query Sequence = NP_010227, Database = Reference Proteins (refseq_protein), Organism = Eremothecium cymbalariae

4. BLAST!

7 sequences found that produce significant alignments. The first sequence has E-value rounded to 0.0 (Sequence_ID XP_003645298.1)

Link to the protein: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/XP_003645298.1?report=genbank&log$=protalign&blast_rank=1&RID=UT6SVB5U014

Link to the organism: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=931890


;Activity 4 - Put information pertaining to MYSPE into JSON files
1. Find UniprotID at https://www.uniprot.org/mapping/

2. Query XP_003645298 from RefSeq Protein to UniProtKB

The UniprotID is G8JQ18

3. To get a protein sequence, copy from the NCBI protein info page and use <code>dbSanitizeSequence()</code>

4. To store in JSON, use the following script:

The motivation for constructing appropriate database models -- how to store data for efficient computation and avoid errors by ensuring self-consistency.

===3.3.1 Data organizing principles===
;Normal Form: A data model is normalized so to "reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization]

;Primary Key: a label that uniquely identifies a record in the database.
:* Pointing to information. Not storing information. It should not depend on the underlying mutable information.
:* However, it can contain information about the database, rather than about an individual record.
:* It's desirable that I define my own primary keys and maintain them myself, so that I can ensure they aren't mutable.
e.g. Instead of storing protein name, which is not unique (many proteins have the same name but in different species) and can result in duplicate storage, use a unique ID independent of entry attributes

;Foreign Key: a primary key in a different table. Appears in current table for cross-referencing.
:* Do not store information/attributes for an entity that does not depend on the entity (unless for computational load reasons... in this case have to ensure the fields are updated).
:* For these attributes, I would create a new table, each entity with a unique primary key. Then, cross-reference.
e.g. The species an entry in ''Proteins'' belongs to would not be stored in ''Proteins'' because species does not depend on the specific protein.

Create a new table called ''Taxonomy'' for cross-referencing.

Each ''Protein'' entity will map to only one ''Taxonomy'', but each ''Taxonomy'' entity can map to any number of ''Protein'' entities. (Species does not depend on the specific protein, but a specific protein corresponds on a unique species)

;Cardinality: How often can we expect a key value to appear in a different table.

;Relationship: a relationship between two tables are described by referencing the primary key of a different table and the cardinalities of such relationship.

;Cardinalities can be used to check my data model:
:* N-to-N: inconsistent model? (e.g. a map between a protein entity and its functions?)
:* 1-to-1: redundant. Attribute depends on the entity and can be stored in the table of the entities (e.g. a map between a protein entity and its protein sequence).

;Store atomic values as attributes:
:* Although what is considered atomic is context dependent.
:* The bottom line is, the data model is such that I only need to parse my data once when I enter it into database.
e.g. For domain regions, it would make sense to store starting residue number and ending residue number separately.

;The value of an attribute should necessarily and sufficiently depend on the entire primary key.
:* This is not the case if I were to create a Feature table whose primary key is a '''composite key''' (protein entity + feature entity).
e.g. Protein-to-Domain map in the course notes example, and Protein-to-Function map suggested above (N-to-N problem). Duplication and inconsistent name problem.

Solution:
;Joint Table (or Junction Table/Associative Entity)
e.g. Create an annotation table with annotation primary keys in the above example. This is a commonly used approach.

'''''The bottom line'''''

* The value of an attribute is specific to the entity record in the table (i.e. functionally dependent on the primary key).
* All attribute is atomic.
* All information is unique (no duplication! Duplicate storing information can risk screwing up and is a bad idea!)

===3.3.2 Build a relational data model for transcription factors===
;Objective: practise constructing a relational data model for the following question:

 Some of the proteins that you might want to store are transcription factors. 
 A transcription factor has a canonical binding site sequence, and there are sequences it actually has been observed to bind to. 
 The actual binding instances in specific locations may have genes associated with them, which encode proteins. 
 You might come up with other facts that are important too.

One version:

[[File:ERDversion1.jpg|500px]] 

Another version (if my idea of "double-joint" works/is a thing.. this would allow getting information of activation or repression of expression):

[[File:ERDversion2.jpg|500px]] 

==3.2 Information Sources for Bioinformatics==

;Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops: https://bioinformatics.ca/
:* Workshops, many learning resources

;International Society for Computational Biology: http://iscb.org

;Journals
:* ''Bioinformatics''
:* ''Nucleic Acids Research'' (It has a really nice current database volume and a Web service volume for each year. 2019 Check out: EncoMPASS<ref>EncoMPASS: an online database for analyzing structure and symmetry in membrane proteins</ref>, The MemProtMD database</ref>The MemProtMD database: a resource for membrane-embedded protein structures and their lipid interactions</ref>)
:* ''BMC Bioinformatics''
:* ''PLoS Computational Biology''

 For each bioinformatics resources/services, look for:
 1. what to expect with such resources and 
 2. how to use the services

==3.1 Motivation==
===3.1.1 Molecular biology can be understood in terms of information flow===
;Dogma:
: DNA sequences --> protein structure --> protein interactions & assembly --> functional circuits of biological systems

;However, we seem to not be able to deterministically infer higher level information from lower level at each step.
: What's getting in the way -- '''incomplete information'''

===3.1.2 Funfamental task: Data management===
* Amount of biological data is huge
* The field is evolving '''very rapidly'''
* Need to make things query-able
* Many challenges: data & service overload, poor integration ...

===3.1.2 Funfamental task: Modelling===
* "Data alone does not explain itself." (B. Steipe)
* It's often not entirely clear what are the best data resources, best analysis tools or services. Again, things go outdated very fast, and it's not often not straightforward to compare resources [insight!]
* This necessitates that bioinformatics is not just about data itself. Bioinformatics aims to contribute to the understanding of biology through modelling.
* This necessitates focusing on objectives rather than methodology.
* Activities have to turn into better understanding. Otherwise, it would just be cargo cult [insight!].

==2.9 Final Notes on Coding Style==
;General principles: clarity, readability, don't get witty, generality, explicitly (ok, the last two are kind of a stretch with the rhyme)

;Comments: Use LOTS of comments. Not just what but also why. Indent to format nicely.

;Headers, separators, and always end your code with an # [END] comment

;def GLOBAL_VARIABLES at the beginning

;'''options()''': set truly global options

;Use <package>::<function>() over library() (explicit)

;Do not mess with the global state

;Try to always else the if statement

;set.seed() to allow reproducible results from codes involving random processes for debugging purposes.
:* set.seed(NULL) to re-initiate with a new seed

==2.8 Plotting==
;Plenty of examples [http://www.r-graph-gallery.com here].

;The power of visualization: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/

===2.8.1 Helpful plotting related functions===
;summary(x)

;quantile(x, probs=<vector>): returns quantiles of the sample x. Specific quantile percentages can be specified in probs=<vector>.

;Sampling from a distribution: rnorm(), runif(), ...

;Built-in plotting functions:
:* plot(): scatter plot
:* rug(): add rugs onto the axes (visually show data distributions)
:* hist(): histogram
:* barplot(): bar graph
:* boxplot(): box-plot
:* stripchart(): (sort of like) 1D scatter plot

;For more: "plottingIntro.R" (B.Steipe)

;QQ-plot assessing normality assumption (by comparing the quantiles between theoretical and sample): qqnorm(), qqline()
:* If two samples are supplied as arguments, these functions also compare the two distributions.

===2.8.2 General principles===
;All plot elements are necessary (no unhelpful redundancy), informative presentation, all information in data displayed

;Plot tells a story: relationships, significance, and insufficiencies converyed by the data -> Not to mislead

===2.5.1 R Commands that may be helpful and used often===
(aka tips I got from "subsettingPractice.R" by B. Steipe)

;sort(x): returns a vector that's x but sorted (from smallest to largest)

;order(x): returns the indices of the elements in x if sorted (useful in subsetting)

;apply(x, <margin>, <function>): apply <function> to all margins of vector-like x. e.g. <margin>=1 would be rows if x is a matrix.

;any(<boolean_vector>): returns TRUE if any of the element in <boolean_vector> is TRUE (<code>|</code> all elements)

;all(<boolean_vector>): returns TRUE if all of the element in <boolean_vector> is TRUE (<code>&</code> all elements)

;grep(<pattern>, x): (might end up being my favourite function) returns indices of elements in x that matches <pattern> '''(supports regex!)'''

;which(<boolean_vector>): returns a vector of indices at which <boolean_vector> is TRUE.

;unique(x): returns a vector of unique elements of x

;duplicated(x): returns a boolean vector. For all positions at which duplication occurs, the element is TRUE.

;<code>%in%</code>: operator &isin

;Can combine boolean vectors with boolean operators when subsetting

;Obviously list is much more versatile and flexible than vectors or data frames (any number of arbitrary types).

===2.4.1 R Commands that may be helpful and used often===
;list(): create a list
:* <name>=<item>: the list will be named this way with <item> having name <name>

;strsplit(<x>, <split>): split string <x> into a list through split markers <split>

;lapply(<x>, <function>): apply <function>(function) iteratively over the list/vector <x>

;unlist(<x>): flattens a list (simplifies <x> to a vector of its atomic components)

===2.4.2 Methods of lists===
;Access the list items:
:* by index (e.g. <code><nowiki>list[[1]]</nowiki></code>) <span style="color:red">'''Double brackets!'''</span>
:* if the list is named, access by name via $ (e.g. <code>list$firstItem</code>) or double brackets (e.g. <code><nowiki>list[[firstItem]]</nowiki></code>)

; Manipulate some lists of plasmid information:
<source lang="R">
#source("R_Exercise-BasicSetup.R")
#init()

pUC19 <- list(size=2686, marker="ampicillin", ori="ColE1", accession="L01397", BanI=c(235, 408, 550, 1647) ) #pUC19 info

(pACYC184 <- list(size=4245, marker=c("Tet", "Cam"), ori="p15A")) #Create a list like with data for pACYC184

plasmidDB <- list()
plasmidDB[["pUC19"]] <- pUC19 #Make a data bank list of plasmids and add pUC19 to it
plasmidDB[["pACYC184"]] <- pACYC184 #Add pACYC184 to it

pBR322 <- list(size=4361, marker=c("Amp", "Tet"), ori="ColE1") #Create a list like with data for pBR322
plasmidDB[["pBR322"]] <- pBR322 #Add pBR322 to it

plasmidDB$pACYC184 #Retrieve the entire pACYC184 list

sizes <- lapply(plasmidDB, function(x) { return(x$size) }) #Get sizes
min(unlist(sizes)) #This should give the smallest size

===2.3.1 R Commands that may be helpful and used often===
;read.table(<path>): load data set as data frame.
:* sep=<separation>(string): separations used in <path> data file. e.g. <code>"\t"</code> for tab in R.
:* header=<boolean>: indicate whether the data file contains variable names as its first line.
:* stringAsFactors=<boolean>: Usually turn this off unless I want to as.factor() all the strings.
   
;data.frame(...): create a data frame. ... in <column_name>=<values> format.
:* row.names=NULL: can specify row names here. The default is NULL.


===2.3.2 Methods for Data frames===
:* Renaming rows/Using a column as row names by assigning directly to its row names: <code>rownames(df) <- df[,1] #First column as row names</code>
:* Same rules for retrieving & removing rows/columns as matrices, with the added feature of retrieving by row/column names.
:* rbind() and cbind() should also work for data frames.


;Playing with plasmidData:

[[User:Zhi Wei Zeng|Zhi Wei Zeng]] ([[User talk:Zhi Wei Zeng|talk]]) 00:37, 7 October 2019 (EDT)
</div>

===2.2.1 R Commands that may be helpful and used often===
;'''objectInfo(<object>): (specially defined function only in R_Exercise-BasicSetup.R): After init(), this function is defined and it returns mode(), typeof(), and class() of the <code><object></code>'''
;It also gives data structure of the object?

;seq(from, to, by): Generates a sequence

;summary(x): summary of x=<object> (e.g. If x is a vector, then it returns basic statistics on this vector such as mean, median etc.)


===2.2.2 Scalars ===
;single valued, but by construction, it's also a vector of length of 1
: e.g. length() and indexing will work

;Objects can have mode, type, and class.

;Important notes:
:* ;An (apparent) integer is by default a double-precision float! To get integer type and class, one has to have <code><integer>L</code>. An alternative is to coerce it into an integer.
:* ;However, integers obtained from range operators (e.g. <code>1:10</code>, which returns a vector) are actual integers!
:* <span style="color:red">'''R indexing starts at 1!!!'''</span>

;Coercion:
:* The names of functions are self-explanatory. Check with objectInfo() if needed: '''as.numeric(), as.character(), as.complex()'''
:* Note that as.numeric("pi") is silly and won't work -- It gives NA (<code>objectInfo(NA)</code> indicates <code>NA</code> is of mode logical, type logical, and class logical)
:* as.logical(x) will return FALSE if x == 0, elif it will return TRUE if x != 0 and x is numeric, else (e.g. if x is a string) will return NA.
:* <code>NaN</code> means "not a number", though it is of mode numeric, type double, and class numeric. '''<code>as.logical(NaN)</code> returns NA.'''
:* <code>NULL</code> means "nothing" or "undefined". It is of mode NULL, type NULL, and class NULL (basically just nothing). e.g. <code>as.logical(NULL)</code> will be the same as <code>as.logical()</code>
:* '''as.factor(x)''' encodes vector x as factor? (back to this later)


===2.2.3 Vectors===
;An ordered array of objects of the same type

;A general way to generate a vector: c() (link to the function on this page?)

;Subsetting:
:* Indexing: e.g. x[1:10], x[5:1], x[seq(1,10,2)]
:* <span style="color:red">'''Negative indices deserves a special note for R'''</span>: the negative indices are the ones to be omitted.
:* Boolean filtering: e.g. x[x>3]
:* If <code>length(<logical_vector>) < length(<vector>)</code>, the <logical_vector> filter will be re-applied in cyclically on <vector>.
:* Indexing by name if it's a named array: e.g. <code>summary(x)[c("Max.", "Min.")]</code>
:* Retrieve names of a named vector using '''names(x)'''

;Extending:
:* Extending a vector by simply assign a value to a vector index larger than its length: e.g. <code>x[4] <- 4</code> works even if <code>length(x) < 4</code> before assignment.

;Many operations on vectors are by default vectorized! (just like NumPy)
:* Similar behaviour to cyclic boolean filtering, if the two vectors on which the operator acts on have different lengths... e.g. <code>(1:10)*(1:5)</code> is the same as <code>(1:10)/rep(1:5,2)</code>


===2.2.4 Matrices and Tensors?===
;Ways to make a matrix
1) To turn a 1-D vector into a matrix/tensor <array>, assign a vector of dimensions to dim(<array>) (e.g. <code>dim(a) <- c(x, y)</code>; the behaviour is similar to numpy.array.reshape() in Python)

2) Use '''matrix()''' or '''array()'''

3) Using '''rbind(...)''' (row bind) or '''cbind(...)''' (column bind)

;dim(a): dimensions of matrix a.
:* if <code>class(a) != "matrix"</code>, <code>dim(a)</code> will return <code>NULL</code>

;<code>nrow(a) == dim(a)[1]; ncol(a) == dim(a)[2]</code>, ... (slice follows at position 3 of dim(a) for a 3-D array)

; Note that unlike numpy.array subsetting, a comma must be given to the subset index of an R-array to retrieve an entire indexed row. For example:
<source lang="R">
a <- 1:12
dim(a) <- c(2,6)

a[1] #This should give 1, the first element
a[1,] #This should give the first row vector, 1:6

a[6] #Without comma, it takes the element at position 6 as if a is a linearized vector
</source>

[[User:Zhi Wei Zeng|Zhi Wei Zeng]] ([[User talk:Zhi Wei Zeng|talk]]) 18:46, 6 October 2019 (EDT)
</div>

===R Commands that may be helpful and used often===
;c(...): concatenates values into a vector (will coerce values into the same type)

;tail(<object>, ...): get the last part of <code><object></code>
:* n=<integer>: get the last <code><integer></code> of <code><object></code>
:* An analogous function: head()

;sample(x, size, replace=FALSE, prob=NULL): randomly sample from elements of <code>x</code>
:* if <code>x</code> is a single numeric >= 1, sample <code>1:x</code> ''(R syntax: <code>x:y</code> means x to y '''inclusive''')''
:* replace=<boolean>: with or without replacement?
:* prob=<vector>: a vector of probability weights


===R syntax practice===
<source lang="R">
numbers <- c(16, 20, 3, 5, 9)
lastnum <- tail(numbers, 1)

(lastnum < 6) | (lastnum > 10) #To check whether lastNum is less than 6 or greater than 10

(lastnum >= 10) & (lastnum < 20) #To check whether lastNum is in the interval [10, 20)

(((((lastnum / 7)*10 - (((lastnum / 7)*10) %/% 1)) / 10) * 100) %/% 1) ^ (1/3) #To output TRUE if the following operation gives 2

#COUNTER-INTUITIVE/STRANGE BEHAVIOUR!!! (lastnum / 7)*10 %/% 1 does not do what I expect it to do
#It does 10 %/% 1 first
#Weird that integer division, while is sort of division, takes priority?
</source>

<span style="color:red"><code>(lastnum / 7)*10 %/% 1</code> does not do what I expect it to do</span>

<span style="color:red">I have to do <code>((lastnum / 7)*10) %/% 1</code></span>

<span style="color:red">Weird that integer division, while is sort of division, takes priority?</span>


===Notes on Variables===
;Can make use of <code>make.names</code> to make syntactically valid variable names from character vectors. See <code>?make.names for more</code>.

;Reserved words for R-parser can be seen in <code>?reserved</code> (e.g. <code>TRUE <- 3</code> won't work)

;Do not re-assign <code>pi</code>!!! Unfortunately it doesn't throw an error.


===Syntax features===
;Just like python, arithmetics in R does not seem to be sensitive to (number of) spaces.

;Unlike python:
:* Booleans (TRUE or FALSE) are case sensitive (RStudio autocorrects)
:* Exponentiation: <code>^</code> (turns out <code>**</code> also works in R)
:* Mod: <code>%%</code>
:* Integer division: <code>%/%</code>
:* Does not support "and" or "or". Only <code>&</code> or <code>|</code>
