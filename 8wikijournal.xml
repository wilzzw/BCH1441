Data come from high throughput methods.

;M/A plot:
M on the vertical axis and A on the horizontal axis. M is the log ratio of expression, and A is the average expression.
:* Consideration of whether a gene is '''significantly''' differentially expressed is probably affected by both (e.g. low A tends to be noisy).

GEO provides many tools for differential expression analysis

;Objective: Search for relevant information from GEO and identify significantly differentially expressed genes.

;Activity - Explore differential expression of Mbp1 and its target genes.

1. Go to NCBI GEO DataSets query page https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/

2. Search the query ""cell cycle"[ti] AND "saccharomyces cerevisiae"[organism]". Filter the "Entry Type" to "DataSets"

3. There are 5 dataset entries. To follow the [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-EXPR-DE#GEO2R instructions of the course], 
I will get the entry with Accession ID of GDS2347

4. The entry redirects to the DataSet Browser page https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS2347

5. See a table. There is a link to the "Reference Series", whose Accession ID is GSE3635. Go to this cross-referenced GEO Series https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE3635.

6. There are descriptions of experimental design and sample information, with the relevant citation.

Samples are taken at time points throughout the cell cycle. Cells were (obviously) synchronized a priori.

7. Do "Analyze with GEO2R" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/?acc=GSE3635)

8. Define groups and assign samples to groups. Since the samples span two cell cycles (2x 60 min) at 10 min intervals. I will make 5 groups, each consisting of the same amount of time into the beginning of cell cycle.

 T0: 0 min & 60 min, N=2
 T1: 10 min & 70 min, N=2
 T2: 20 min & 80 min, N=2
 T3: 30 min & 90 min, N=2
 T4: 40 min & 100 min, N=2
 T5: 50 min & 110 min, N=2
 (Leave out 130 min sample)

9. From the tab "Value Distribution", the expression distribution of samples are more or less unbiased:

[[File:expr_boxplt.jpg|300px]]

10. Under "GEO2R", look at "Top 250".

 Many of the top hits are histone proteins and DNA replication machineries. They are expected to be differentially expressed throughout cell cycle.

 MBP1 is not one of the top 250 hits! Swi6 is but not one of the top hits among top 250.

<span style="color:red">The website is incredibly bad imo... Takes way too long than reasonable to display drop-down for each entry expression profile.</span>

 The algorithm finds genes that have high inter-group variances and low intra-group variances. It does not assume group-dependent patterns of expression.

11. Re-group the samples:

 A: 0 min, 10 min, 60 min, 70 min, N=4 (in between cell cycles)
 B: 30 min, 40 min, 90 min, 100 min, N=4 (in the middle of cell cycles)

Results are expected to change.

 Out of DSE1, DSE2, ERF3, HTA2, HTB2, and GAS3, only HTA2, HTB2, and GAS3 are in the top 250. MBP1 appears in top 250 while SWI6 is gone.

12. Search the query "(Mbp1 OR Swi6 OR Swi4 OR Nrm1 OR Cln1 OR Clb6 OR Act1 OR Alg9) AND GSE3635" in GEO Profiles.

13. Go to [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/tools/profileGraph.cgi?ID=GDS2347:YDL056W entry of MBP1]. The graphical view of expression over time is more apparently cyclic. Can probably fit with a sine curve or calculate time-correlation.

14. R-scripts used for analysis is available for GEO2R

Overview of GEO database: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4944384/

;Retrieving GEO record:
GEO Accession Number
:* Types: Series (GSExxx), Sample (GSMxxx), Platform (GPLxxx) and DataSet (GDSxxx)

<span style="color:red">Key things to know for this session are these entry types</span>

Keyword search among databases
:* GEO DataSets: search for studies of interest. Entries/records commonly have Organism, Experiment Type & Design.
:* GEO Profiles: search for expression profile of genes

;Activity 1 - Give GEO Profiles a Try with MBP1
1. Search NCBI - GEO Profiles with the query "Mbp1 AND (Saccharomyces cerevisiae[Organism])"

2. Entries are annotated with GPLxxx platforms, GDSxxx datasets, dataset type, SGD ID for the protein YDL056W, and name "MBP1".
There is also a thumbnail clickable showing expression levels in all samples with graphics. Curated?

;GEO-BLAST:
Database contains all sequences from Microarrays participating in GEO DataSet from GenBank?

;GEO DataSet:
:* Can find info of other genes in this DataSet
:* Can compare 2 sets of samples with statistical tests
:* Can cluster heatmaps
:* Protocol and distribution of values of samples are viewable

;GEO Profile:
I use https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geoprofiles/16205984 as an example of GEO profile to inspect.
:* Can find profile neighbours, aka get profiles of genes of similar expression pattern '''within the same DataSet''' (based on Pearson corr. coeff. but it would be nice if the coeff. are displayed..)
:* Can find up-to-20 chromosome neighbours in the same DataSet
:* Other neighbours: Sequence neighbours (based on BLAST seq. similarity), homologene neighbours (from the same HomoloGene group)
:* Find pathway/cluster though "Pathways + GO"? <span style="color:red">I didn't see a "Find Pathways" button.. </span>

;GEO2R:
Analysis and visualization tools. Can be found in accession display for a GEO entry. Based on R-language.

;Genome Data Viewer:
Visualization.. Zoom in and zoom out?

;Downloads:
Often from GEO Series. Downloadable formats:
:* SOFT (Simple Omnibus Format in Text): plain-text
:* MINiML (MIAME Notation in Markup Language): XML
:* Series Matrix File(s): ?

;Experiment:
1. Microarrays: Detect mRNA levels by probes on a chip

2. RNA Sequencing: More direct and more prevalent nowadays. Align fragments to reference genome. However, converting reads of mRNA fragments to counts require "stochastic weighting".
: In addition, alignment to the reference genome should be "splice-aware" 

;Types of data files/formats:
:* SAM (sequence alignment map) & BAM (binary SAM) files: mapping of reads to the genome
:* BED files: specifies regions of interest in SAM/BAM. Extensive annotation and subsetting.

;Conversion of reads to counts:
e.g. RPKM, FPKM

;Expression databases:
:* GEO (NCBI): microarray and RNA-seq expression data
:* Expression Atlas (EMBL-EBI)

;Key questions:
Expressions and differential expressions of genes
