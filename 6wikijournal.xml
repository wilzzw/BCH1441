Line 99-131: Functions defined to generate alternative genetic codes.

;Activity 1 - Explore the effect of mutations on a sequence if alternative genetic code were used.

;Plan: "Reverse-translate" a protein sequence Mbp1 into a nucleotide sequence, make mutations, and translate it back.
:* Observe: See whether different genetic codes differ in mutation severity.

Methodologies defined into functions.

Line 218-220: To determine severity of mutation, first group amino acids into biophysical categories (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, neutral)

Line 222-226: Give different types of mutations penalty scores (e.g. nonsense mutation has the highest penalty).

Define a function to evaluate mutation severity based on the penalty scores.

(I feel like I have seen this warning message somewhere when reading from file in another learning unit. Basically it's better to end with something like '\n'? A good practice to end..)

Run a number of random trials of mutation experiments and histogram the resulting mutation penalties.

Run the same experiment using an alternative set of genetic code. Compare the histograms.

Conclusion: Histograms suggest the mutations have greater risky impact for the alternative genetic code than the standard genetic code used by nature.

;Activity 2 - Run the same experiment for amino acid-swapped genetic code

R-code below for running such experiment
<source lang="R">
N <- 200
valSWGC <- numeric(N)

set.seed(112358)
for (i in 1:N) {
    swGC <- swappedGC(stdCode)
    x <- traRev(myAA, swGC)
    x <- randMut(x)
    x <- traFor(x, swGC)
    valSWGC[i] <- evalMut(myAA, x)
}
set.seed(NULL)

#Optionally recover the histogram for standard genetic code
hist(valSTDC,
     breaks = 15,
     col = "palegoldenrod",
     xlim = c(0, 400),
     ylim = c(0, N/4),
     main = "Standard vs. Swapped Genetic Code",
     xlab = "Mutation penalty")

hist(valSWGC,
     col = "plum",
     breaks = 60,
     add = TRUE)
</source>

;Conclusion: Overall alternative genetic code generated by swapping encoding amino acids produce more severe mutations than standard genetic code.

Seems not as bad as a randomly generated genetic code in the previous example though.

#         tautomerization process that favours C -> T changes. If the code
#         indeed minimizes the effect of mutations, you would expect that

===6.1.3 Useful R functions===
;names(x): get the vector of names for named vector <code>x</code>

;attr(x, <which>): get or set special attributes of <code>x</code> (sort of like class methods?)

;str(x): internal structure of an arbitrary object <code>x</code>

;readLines(<path>): read lines from the file specified in <code><path</code> (<code>?readLines</code> says it reads from "connection"?)

;nchar(<string>): returns number of characters in the <code><string></code>

;table(<sequence>) returns a table of amino acid frequencies (<code><sequence></code> should be a vector of amino acid one-letter code strings)
:* Or in general, seems like the argument can be any vector, and it returns a named vector with non-repetitive elements of the argument vector as names and their frequencies as elements
